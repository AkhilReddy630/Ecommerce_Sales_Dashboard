 E-Commerce Sales Dashboard – Power BI

 Overview

In this project, I analyzed an e-commerce dataset to identify key sales and profit trends. By examining product performance, regional revenue, customer behavior, and payment preferences, I generated actionable insights to help businesses:

 Identify high-profit product categories
 Explore regional sales opportunities
 Improve customer targeting and retention
 Optimize pricing, promotions, and inventory planning



 My Role & Solution

As the Data Analyst for this project, I handled data preparation, analysis, and visualization using Power BI. My goal was to create an interactive dashboard that supports data-driven decision making.

 1. Data Preparation & Validation

 Imported and cleaned a Kaggle e-commerce dataset
 Verified data types, relationships, and category consistency
 Built a robust Power BI data model for efficient analysis

 2. Developed Key DAX Measures

I created measures to track critical business metrics:

 Total Sales = `SUM(Details[Amount])`
 Total Profit = `SUM(Details[Profit])`
 Total Quantity = `SUM(Details[Quantity])`
 Average Order Value (AOV) = `[Total Sales] / DISTINCTCOUNT(Details[OrderID])`

These measures enabled interactive reporting and KPI tracking.

 3. Dashboard Design

I designed an interactive Power BI dashboard featuring:

 KPI Cards: Sales, Profit, Quantity, AOV
 Monthly Profit Trend
 Profit by Sub-Category
 Quantity by Category
 Sales by Customer and State
 Payment Mode Breakdown

I ensured the dashboard is interactive and user-friendly, allowing stakeholders to explore insights with dynamic filters and visuals.

 4. Automated Reporting

I implemented automated reporting so that visuals refresh with a single click, eliminating repetitive Excel tasks and saving time.



 Insights & Recommendations

 High-Profit Categories: Clothing generates higher profit than electronics and furniture. I recommended promoting these items to maximize margin.
 Regional Revenue: Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh lead in revenue. I suggested focusing marketing on lower-performing states and optimizing inventory for high-demand regions.
 Key Customers: A small group of customers drives a large share of sales. I recommended loyalty programs and personalized offers to retain these high-value customers.
 Payment Preferences: COD and UPI are the most popular payment options. Streamlining these methods can improve customer satisfaction.
 Seasonal Trends: Profits peak in January and November. I advised aligning inventory and campaigns with seasonal demand.



 Business Impact

Through this project, I helped demonstrate how businesses can turn raw data into actionable insights:

 Improved decision-making with automated, interactive visuals
 Clear identification of profitable categories, regions, and customers
 Better planning for marketing, inventory, and seasonal campaigns
 Reusable reporting solution requiring minimal manual effort

By combining data cleaning, DAX analysis, and interactive Power BI visuals, I showcased a practical, data-driven approach to e-commerce decision making.
