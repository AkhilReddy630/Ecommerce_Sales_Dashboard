# Ecommerce_Sales_Dashboard


 📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing an e-commerce dataset to uncover key sales, profit, and customer behavior trends. Using Power BI, I developed an interactive dashboard that helps businesses:

 📈 Identify high-profit product categories
 🌍 Explore regional sales opportunities
 👥 Improve customer targeting and retention
 🏷️ Optimize pricing, promotions, and inventory planning



 👨‍💻 My Role & Solution

 As the Data Analyst, I handled:

 Data cleaning & modeling
 DAX measure creation
 Dashboard design
 Automated reporting setup

The goal was to build an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard that supports fast, data-driven decision-making.



 🗂️ Data Preparation & Validation

 Imported and cleaned a Kaggle e-commerce dataset
 Verified data types, relationships, and category consistency
 Built a structured Power BI data model for efficient analysis



 🧮 Key DAX Measures

These DAX measures powered KPI tracking across visuals:

DAX
Total Sales = SUM(Details[Amount])

Total Profit = SUM(Details[Profit])

Total Quantity = SUM(Details[Quantity])

Average Order Value (AOV) = [Total Sales] / DISTINCTCOUNT(Details[OrderID])




 📊 Dashboard Design

The dashboard includes:

 KPI Cards → Sales, Profit, Quantity, AOV
 📅 Monthly Profit Trend
 📦 Profit by Sub-Category
 📚 Quantity by Category
 👤 Sales by Customer
 🗺️ Sales by State
 💳 Payment Mode Breakdown
 🔍 Interactive filters for dynamic exploration

The dashboard is designed to be clean, intuitive, and decision-focused.



 🔄 Automated Reporting

 Enabled one-click refresh for the full dashboard
 Eliminated repetitive Excel-based manual reporting
 Ensured consistency and time savings
